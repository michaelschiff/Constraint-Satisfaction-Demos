Constraint-Satisfaction-Demos
=============================
These demos were built to aide students taking CS188.  They consist of a 4Queens explanation, a demo of the MinConflict algorithm on the 4Queens example, and a demonstration of Backtracking Search to solve the MapColoring problem.

There is also an example of Value Iteration as an implementation of Markov Decision Processes.
